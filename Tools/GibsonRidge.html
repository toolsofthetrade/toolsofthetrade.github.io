	  <h4>About</h4>
	  <p><span id="tab"></span> Since 2008, Ross Lazear has been an instructor in the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at the University at Albany, SUNY.  Originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota, he received his Bachelors and Masters degrees in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 2005 and 2007, respectively.  For his Masters work, Ross was advised by Dr. Michael Morgan, studying the effects of diabatic heating on block development and maintenance, and tropical cyclone outflow circulations.  While a graduate student at Wisconsin, Ross had the opportunity to lead his own lab section under Dr. Jonathan Martin’s introductory atmospheric science class.  This experience inspired him to want to be a teacher, and helped land him his current position, where he teaches courses on synoptic-scale weather analysis, forecasting, and severe weather.  In addition to running the local forecasting contests at Albany, he also advises undergraduate research, works with the National Weather Service in coordinating the internship program, runs the department’s weather map room, and provides forecasts for the University and public prior to major weather events.  Ross loves experiencing extreme weather, and has had the opportunity to chase Hurricane Katrina, as well as several Great Plains and upstate New York severe weather outbreaks. <br>
