	  <h4>About</h4>
	  <p><span id="tab"></span>Kevin Tyle is a Senior Programmer/Analyst in the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences (DAES) at the University at Albany (UAlbany).  He received his M.S. in Atmospheric Science from UAlbany in 1995.  He spent two years working at NCEP, developing software for N-AWIPS and GEMPAK.  Kevin then worked as a software developer and system administrator for MESO, Inc. in Troy, New York from 1997-2001, before returning to his alma mater in 2001.  He has used a wide variety of data analysis and visualization software in his student and professional careers.  He co-teaches a course each spring intended for atmospheric science majors, “Meteorological Data Analysis and Visualization”, where students use programs such as IDV and GEMPAK to analyze and display weather data in a variety of formats. <br>
	  <span id="tab"></span>Kevin has always had an interest in computing and all things related to data analysis and visualization, but things really caught fire following his attendance at a Unidata IDV regional training workshop in 2008 at Plymouth State University.  He joined the Unidata Users Committee in 2009 and co-chaired the 2012 Unidata Triennial Users Workshop, “Navigating Earth System Science Data”.  From 2012 to 2015, he served as Chair of the Users Committee, and played a key role in organizing the 2015 Unidata Triennial Users Workshop, “Data-Driven Geoscience:  Applications, Opportunities, Trends and Challenges”. <br>
	  <span id="tab"></span>Kevin is actively involved in promoting awareness of and aptitude in tools that relate to meteorological data analysis and visualization.  Besides his class, he is co-leader of a department-based computing and data interest group which meets monthly.  The group serves as a place for students, faculty, and staff both inside and outside the department to master tools such as databases, Python, Javascript and GitHub in their classes and research. <br>
