	  <h4>About</h4>
	  <p><span id="tab"></span>Greg has been with UNC Asheville’s National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center (NEMAC) for nearly 10 years, serving first as the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Coordinator before becoming the Director of Geospatial Technology, in addition to being a Research Scientist during this time. He is responsible for all of NEMAC's GIS activities, research, mapping, and development. In this capacity he coordinates and provides GIS support for the Center’s various projects. His current research interests include: (1) GIS applications for applied physical geography (land use, natural hazards, climate, hydrology, extreme weather); (2) GIS as a decision support tool; (3) the integration of GIS with weather, climate, and society (societal impacts); (4) geospatial visualization (2D and 3D) and web mapping technologies; and (5) the use of geospatial technologies for effective science communication and outreach. <br>					
	  <span id="tab"></span>In addition to his responsibilities as NEMAC's GIS Coordinator, Greg also serves as an Adjunct Faculty member in the Atmospheric Sciences Department at UNC Asheville, where he developed and continues to teach a GIS course for meteorology majors titled “GIS in Meteorology”. He also teaches introductory GIS courses as an Adjunct Faculty member at a local community college. Greg holds a B.S. in Geography from East Tennessee State University and an M.A. in Geography from Appalachian State University, both with concentrations in GIS. He also holds the GISP (professional) Certification from the GIS Certification Institute.

    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>Dr. Olga Wilhelmi is a geographer whose research interests focus on interactions among weather, climate and society across scales, with the main emphasis on understanding societal risk, vulnerability and adaptive capacity to extreme weather events and climate change. Olga is a project scientist in the Research Application Laboratory and the head of the Geographic Information Science Program at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. NCAR’s GIS program is an interdisciplinary research effort that integrates atmospheric, environmental and social sciences through spatial analysis and interoperability of georeferenced information. Olga is a graduate of Lomonosov Moscow State University where she majored in physical geography. She completed her Ph.D. in the School of Natural Resources at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1999. Olga has been leading and participating in numerous research activities and has written peer-reviewed articles, chapters, and reports addressing societal aspects of weather extremes and climate change; urban extreme heat and human health; drought vulnerability and water management; extreme precipitation events and flash floods; and the methodologies for integration of physical and social sciences in a GIS.
