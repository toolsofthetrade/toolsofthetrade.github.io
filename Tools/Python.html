	  <h4>About</h4>
	  <p><span id="tab"></span>From AR. In OK. Has PhD. Pokes bears w/ sticks. Codes. Plays w/ data. Does weather. Mentors. Eats PB M&Ms. Tries to save NWS from itself. Once known as snow guy." <br>
Patrick Marsh (@pmarshwx) is a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, OK. Prior to joining the NWS SPC, Patrick was the National Severe Storms Laboratory's Liaison to the Hazardous Weather Testbed, a position the afforded him the opportunity to work on his doctoral degree at the University of Oklahoma. Before earning his meteorology Masters and PhD from the University of Oklahoma, he earned a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Arkansas. <br>
<span id="tab"></span>Patrick has developed a reputation for "playing with data", which also serves as the name of his blog. He frequently develops visualizations of complex meteorological information that has been featured in numerous blogs, television shows, and other publications. One of the more popular software projects he founded, SHARPpy, a Sounding/Hodograph viewer written in Python, is currently used by dozens of meteorological organizations across the world. Patrick is not afraid of using his data analysis skills to contradict prevailing wisdom, earning him the reputation as a "bear poker". <br>
<span id="tab"></span>In addition to being a meteorologist at the NOAA/NWS SPC and software developer, Patrick frequently serves as a mentor to students. As a graduate student at OU, Patrick worked with dozens of students on capstone projects and synoptic presentations. In a more formal capacity, Patrick has supervised students under the National Weather Center Research Experience for Undergraduates and the NOAA Hollings Scholarship program. <br>
<span id="tab"></span>Lastly, Patrick and his wife Sarah (who holds a PhD in Mathematics from the University of Oklahoma) have been married for over 10 years and are expecting their first child this spring. </p>

	  <h4>About</h4>
	  <p><span id="tab"></span>Ryan May is a software engineer at Unidata, part of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) Community Programs, working on Python software and training for the atmospheric science community. Ryan began his meteorology career pursuing a B.S. in Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma in 1999. During this time, he worked as a student at the National Weather Service Radar Operations Center, igniting a passion for both radar meteorology and software development. Ryan’s dual passions continued to drive his graduate studies in meteorology at the University of Oklahoma, where he completed his M.S. in 2005 and Ph.D. in 2014, focusing his research on the simulation of dual polarization radar signals. Starting in 2009, while completing his Ph.D., Ryan began working as a software engineer on visualization and data processing algorithms for weather radar data at Enterprise Electronics Corporation. In 2014, Ryan started at Unidata, exchanging working on radar meteorology for working on tools for meteorology in Python. Currently, he is the core developer of the MetPy and Siphon Python packages, as well as a member of the development team for the matplotlib Python visualization library.</p>

          <h4>About</h4>
	  <p><span id="tab"></span>Brian Rose is a climate dynamicist and modeler with broad curiosity about the global climate system, and a deep interest in Earth history. He studies atmosphere, ocean and sea ice processes using hierarchies of numerical and mathematical models, with topics ranging from Snowball Earth to future global warming to climates of exoplanets. He is also a developer of open-source software and a strong proponent of open, reproducible science.<br>
	  <span id="tab"></span>Originally from Canada, Dr. Rose holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in Atmospheric Science from McGill University, and a Ph.D. in Climate Physics and Chemistry from MIT. His Ph.D. thesis entitled "Oceanic Control of the Sea Ice Edge and Multiple Equilibria in the Climate System" was awarded the Rossby Prize in 2010. Dr. Rose subsequently worked at the University of Washington funded by the NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship. In 2013 he moved to upstate New York to join the University at Albany as faculty member of the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. His research is currently funded by the prestigious CAREER award from the National Science Foundation.</p>
